## Project Summary

YouTube Trending Video Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset?resource=download&select=US_youtube_trending_data.csv

Our project is called Trendify and will be drawing from the YouTube Trending Video Dataset on Kaggle. Users select the country they want data from to determine the language. From there they type in their title or keywords related to their title and our project suggests the most trending keywords for them to use. The user can then add these results to their titles/captions/hashtags. If they do not input anything, we return the tags/keywords that appear most frequently among the highest-ranking videos or posts. Alongside the connected tags, our application will display the most trending videos. Users can also search for specific YouTube channels, from which we will pull the most common tags. Other functionalities are listed in the functionality section.

More information can be found in the Project Proposal in the docs folder.
